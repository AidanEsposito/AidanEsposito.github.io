            <h2>About Cod</h2>
            <p>Have you ever loved fishing but can't bring your fishing love to the world of programming? This problem can be seen all around the world with fishermen and fisherwoman struggling to make their dreams a reality. Now, today is the day to make those dreams come true. 
                Introducing the COD language which is a class based statically typed language based around the theme of fishing! COD was based on a love for fishing and 
                its ideas and therefore integrates fishing lingo and ideas throughout the language syntax.</p>
                
                <p>This language also has a wide variety of features not limited to:
                being Statically Typed, Class based, Complete lack of ;, Left to Right argument evaluation, Use of Public and Private type ideas for hiding,
                while, for, and number of time loops, Break and Continue like statements, Functions with a type,  specific character types, and class types</p>

                <p>This language was made by the programmers Aidan Esposito, Troy Wu, and Khalid Stewart. We are all computer science students at Loyola Marymount University.
                    We all hope this language grows into something great and is used for many fisihing enthusiasts including ourselves.
