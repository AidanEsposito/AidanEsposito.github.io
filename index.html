        <h2>About Cod</h2>
        <p>
          Have you ever loved fishing but can't bring your fishing love to the
          world of programming? This problem can be seen all around the world
          with fishermen and fisherwoman struggling to make their dreams a
          reality. Now, today is the day to make those dreams come true.
          Introducing the COD language which is a class-based statically typed
          language based around the theme of fishing! COD was based on a love
          for fishing and its ideas and therefore integrates fishing lingo and
          ideas throughout the language syntax.
        </p>

        <p>
          This language also has a wide variety of features not limited to:
          being Statically Typed, Class-based, Complete lack of ;, Left-to-Right
          argument evaluation, Use of Public and Private type ideas for hiding,
          while, for, and a number of time loops, Break and Continue-like
          statements, Functions with a type, specific character types, and class
          types
        </p>

        <p>
          This language was made by the programmers Aidan Esposito, Troy Wu, and
          Khalid Stewart. We are all computer science students at Loyola
          Marymount University. We all hope this language grows into something
          great and is used for many fishing enthusiasts including ourselves.
